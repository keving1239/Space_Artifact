# Space_Artifact
Just a scene I created using OpenGL

Note that Mingw, GLAD, and OpenGL are requirede for this project.
Also note that I only wrote the simulation, fragment_shader, and vertex_shader files. All other files in the library and build were class files at 
Kennesaw State Universiy written by Ben Setzer.
